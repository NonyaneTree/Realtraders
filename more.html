                description: "Bearish reversal pattern resembling the letter 'M'",
                details: "The M formation is a classic chart pattern in technical analysis used in trading financial markets (stocks, forex, crypto, etc.). It looks like the letter "M" on a price chart and generally signals a potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish (a price top).

What it looks like:

Price rises to a peak (first top of the M)

Then drops to a support level (the valley between the two peaks)

Price rises again but fails to break above the first peak (second top of the M)

Then price falls again — often breaking the support level (the valley), confirming the reversal

Why is it important?

The M formation suggests the buyers tried twice to push the price higher but failed the second time.

This pattern often signals that the upward momentum is weakening and the price may start to drop.

Traders often use it to spot selling opportunities or prepare for a downtrend.
 1. Detailed Structure of the M Formation (Double Top)

First Peak: Price rises strongly and forms a high point (first top).

Pullback: After hitting the peak, price retraces down to a support zone (valley or neckline).

Second Peak: Price rallies again but fails to surpass or significantly break the first peak. This forms the second top.

Breakdown: After the second peak, price falls and breaks below the valley (support level between the two peaks).
2. Psychology Behind the M Formation

First Top: Buyers push the price up, showing bullish strength.

Pullback: Sellers step in, profit-taking or new shorts push price down to support.

Second Top: Buyers attempt to continue the rally but lack the strength to break the previous high.

Breakdown: Sellers overwhelm buyers, pushing price below the support — signaling a shift from bullish to bearish control.

3. Important Characteristics and Variations

Volume: Often, volume is high on the first peak but lower on the second peak, showing weakening buying interest.

Timeframe: Can form on any timeframe — from minutes to months. Longer timeframes (daily, weekly) are more reliable.

Symmetry: The two peaks should be roughly at the same price level for a textbook pattern, but some variation is acceptable.

Neckline: The valley or support line connecting the low between the two peaks. Breaking this line confirms the pattern.
4. Confirmation of the Pattern

The pattern is confirmed only when the price breaks below the neckline/support between the two peaks.

Sometimes, price might bounce back after breaking the neckline (a retest), offering a good entry for shorts.

Without this breakdown, the pattern might fail, and price could resume its uptrend.
5. Trading Strategies Using the M Formation

Entry: Short (sell) when price breaks and closes below the neckline.

Stop-loss: Usually placed just above the second top or slightly above the neckline if you enter on a retest.

Target: Measure the distance from the neckline to the peaks and project it down from the neckline. For example, if the peak is 50 pips above the neckline, expect a drop of about 50 pips after breakdown.

6. Common Mistakes & Risks

False Breakouts: Price may temporarily break the neckline and reverse, trapping sellers.

Unclear Peaks: Sometimes the tops aren’t well-formed, making pattern recognition difficult.

Ignoring Volume: Low volume on the breakdown might signal weak bearish conviction.

Context: M pattern in a strong uptrend might be less reliable; always consider overall trend and market conditions.
7. Example in Real Markets

In stock charts, you might see an M pattern after a strong rally.

In forex, pairs often form this pattern at resistance levels.

In crypto, due to volatility, M formations can appear quickly and be less reliable without confirmation.",
