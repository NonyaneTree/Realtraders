      "how to trade m formation": {
  image: "mformation.png",
  description: `The M Formation is a powerful bearish reversal pattern. Here's how to properly trade it:

1. Identification:
- Forms after an uptrend
- Two clear peaks at similar price levels (shoulders)
- A higher peak in the middle (head)
- Neckline support connecting the lows

2. Entry Triggers:
A) Conservative Approach:
- Wait for price to break below the neckline
- Enter short on retest of broken neckline
- Place stop loss above the right shoulder

B) Aggressive Approach:
- Enter short when price rejects from the right shoulder
- Confirm with bearish candlestick patterns
- Stop loss above the head

3. Stop Loss Placement:
- Above the right shoulder (for conservative entries)
- Above the head (for aggressive entries)
- Typically 1-2% above the structure

4. Take Profit Targets:
- First Target: Measure height from head to neckline, project downward
- Second Target: 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the pattern
- Look for previous support levels as profit zones

5. Confirmation Signals:
- Volume increases on breakdown
- Bearish candlesticks at right shoulder
- RSI/MACD showing divergence

6. Risk Management:
- Risk no more than 1-2% per trade
- Adjust position size based on stop distance
- Consider partial profits at first target

Example: If head forms at R100, neckline at $90:
- Breakdown entry at R89.50
- Stop loss at R92 (above right shoulder)
- First target at R80 (head-neckline distance)
- Second target at R72 (1.618 extension)`
